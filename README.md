# Adaptive Just-In-Time Compiler with Machine Learning Optimization

An innovative Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that uses machine learning to dynamically optimize code execution paths based on real-time workload characteristics.

## Project Overview

This project implements an adaptive JIT compiler that leverages machine learning techniques to make intelligent optimization decisions during runtime. By analyzing program behavior patterns and performance metrics, the system continuously learns and adapts its optimization strategies to improve execution efficiency.

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **JIT Compiler Frontend (C++)**
   - Code parsing and IR generation
   - Feature extraction from running programs
   - Integration with LLVM backend

2. **Machine Learning Optimization Engine (Python)**
   - Real-time optimization decision making
   - Model training and adaptation
   - Performance metric analysis

3. **LLVM Backend Integration**
   - Code generation and optimization
   - Runtime performance monitoring
   - Dynamic recompilation support

## Key Features

- Dynamic optimization based on runtime behavior
- Real-time performance monitoring and adaptation
- Machine learning-driven decision making
- Integration with LLVM compilation infrastructure
- Comprehensive benchmarking and performance analysis

## Requirements

### Languages
- C++ (17 or later)
- Python (3.8 or later)

### Frameworks and Libraries
- LLVM (latest stable release)
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas

### Development Tools
- CMake
- Git
- GCC/Clang

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

1. Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Ensure LLVM is installed on your system:
   - macOS: `brew install llvm`
   - Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install llvm`

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adaptive-jit-ml.git
cd adaptive-jit-ml
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Running Tests

Run the test suite to verify everything is working:
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

### Using the JIT Compiler

The adaptive JIT compiler can be used in two modes:

1. **Training Mode**: Collects runtime data and trains the ML model
```python
from src.ml_engine.trainer import ModelTrainer
from src.ml_engine.feature_extractor import FeatureExtractor

# Initialize components
trainer = ModelTrainer('path/to/config.json')
extractor = FeatureExtractor()

# Train the model
trainer.train(training_data, validation_data)
```

2. **Inference Mode**: Uses the trained model for optimization decisions
```python
from src.ml_engine.optimizer import JITOptimizer

# Initialize optimizer with trained model
optimizer = JITOptimizer('path/to/model.h5')

# Get optimization decision
decision = optimizer.decide(code_features)
```
